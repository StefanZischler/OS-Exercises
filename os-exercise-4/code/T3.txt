The main difference between physical and virtual memory is that the physical memory refers to the actual RAM of the system attached to the motherboard,
but the virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows the users to execute programs larger than the actual physical memory.

Physical Memory:
- actual RAM, stores currently executing programs
- actual memory
- faster
- uses swapping
- limited trough (physical) RAM
- can directly access CPU

Virtual/Logical Memory:
- memory management technique that creates illusion of larger physical memory for user
- slower
- uses paging
- limited by size of the disk
- cannot access CPU directly
