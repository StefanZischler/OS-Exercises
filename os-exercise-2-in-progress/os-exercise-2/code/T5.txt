Concurrency is when two or more tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. 
It doesn't necessarily mean they'll ever both be running at the same instant. For example, multitasking on a single-core machine.
In other words, Concurrency means executing multiple tasks at the same time but not necessarily simultaneously. 
Often used in 1-core Systems.

Parallelism means that an application splits its tasks up into smaller subtasks which can be processed in parallel, for instance on multiple CPUs at the exact same time.
Parallelism uses Concurrency but on the other hand Concurrency doesn't need Parallelism.

  -> A system is said to be concurrent if it can support two or more actions in progress at the same time. 
  -> A system is said to be parallel if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously.
  
In summary: Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things simultaneously.
